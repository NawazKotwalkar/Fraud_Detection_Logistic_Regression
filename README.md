# Fraud_Detection_Logistic_Regression
Financial fraud detection using Logistic Regression with emphasis on recall, scalability, and business-aligned evaluation metrics.

The dataset used in this project was provided by Accredian as part of an assessment.
Due to its large size (~450 MB) and data-sharing restrictions, it is not included in this repository.
The notebook assumes the dataset is available locally.
